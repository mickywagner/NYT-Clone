<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>This is an HTML/CSS only clone of a New York Times article I made for the HTML/CSS course on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a> as part of their Full Stack Javascript track. The goal of the project was to practice positioning numerous elements, using CSS positioning techniques, including FlexBox, Grid and plain old floats. This is just an HTML/CSS study so no functionality, but it is responsive.
